                <h1>Levi Ackerman</h1>
                <p>Levi has short, straight black hair styled in an undercut, as well as narrow, intimidating dull gray
                    eyes with dark circles under them and a deceptively youthful face. He is quite short, but his
                    physique is well-developed in musculature from extensive vertical maneuvering equipment usage. He is
                    usually either frowning or expressionless; that, plus his extremely calm demeanor, often makes it
                    difficult for others to guess what he is thinking.

                    He is most often seen in his Survey Corps uniform, with a light gray button up shirt underneath
                    along with his trademark white ascot. When embarking on expeditions outside the Walls, he also wears
                    the Survey Corps' green hooded cloak. Once, when forced to take leave from his duties due to injury,
                    Levi was seen in a black suit, plain white shirt, ascot, and dress shoes.[citation needed] However,
                    since the beginning of the coup d'état, he has left the ascot off. For most of the time during which
                    the Survey Corps were on the run from the military and monarchy, he simply wore his vertical
                    maneuvering equipment harness over casual clothes.[citation needed]</p>
